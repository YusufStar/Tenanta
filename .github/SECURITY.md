- **Type of issue** (e.g., buffer overflow, SQL injection, cross-site scripting, etc.)
- **Full paths** of source file(s) related to the manifestation of the issue
- **Location** of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
- **Step-by-step instructions** to reproduce the issue
- **Proof-of-concept or exploit code** (if possible)
- **Impact** of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit it

### Response Timeline

- **Rate Limiting**: Protection against brute force attacks
- **Input Validation**: All inputs are validated and sanitized
- **SQL Injection Prevention**: Parameterized queries and ORM usage
- **CORS Configuration**: Proper cross-origin resource sharing setup
- **Helmet.js**: Security headers for Express.js applications

### Database Security
- **Isolated Tenants**: Each tenant has isolated database access
- **Connection Pooling**: Secure database connection management
- **Encrypted Passwords**: All passwords are hashed using bcrypt
- **Environment Variables**: Sensitive data stored in environment variables

### Infrastructure Security
- **Docker Security**: Secure container configurations

## 🔐 Security Best Practices for Users

### For Developers
- Always use environment variables for sensitive data
- Keep dependencies updated regularly
- Use HTTPS in production environments
- Implement proper logging and monitoring
- Regular security audits of your tenant databases

### For Production Deployment
- Use strong passwords for database credentials
- Enable firewall rules to restrict database access
- Regularly backup your data
- Monitor logs for suspicious activities
- Keep the Tenanta platform updated

## 🚨 Known Security Considerations

### Multi-Tenant Architecture
- Tenant isolation is critical - ensure proper database separation
- Validate tenant access in all API endpoints
- Monitor cross-tenant data access attempts

### Database Management
- SQL Editor has admin privileges - restrict access appropriately
- Schema modifications can affect data integrity
- Monitor database queries for malicious patterns

### Redis Security
- Redis instances are isolated per tenant
- Secure Redis with passwords in production
- Monitor Redis for unauthorized access attempts
